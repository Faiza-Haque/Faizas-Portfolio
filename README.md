# Homework-2

Challenge 02 - due 04/11/24 Completed by Faiza Haque for UCB Extension Coding Bootcamp

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can't be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

With these points in mind, in this Challenge you'll set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

 **User Story**: This is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who is requesting the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. This follows an AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format. For example, "AS A shopper visiting an online store, I WANT to place items in a shopping cart, SO THAT I can purchase them." 

 **Acceptance Criteria**: These are the requirements that you must meet to satisfy the scope of work. They are not exhaustive, but they do entail the minimum aspects of a working solution. Consider this a checklist of baseline requirements. Acceptance criteria can be presented in various ways. In this case, we'll use a common format called **scenario-oriented criteria** which expresses each requirement in a WHEN / THEN format. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense now; it will become very familiar to you after you complete a couple of Challenges.
